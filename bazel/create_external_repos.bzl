    """Creates external repos needed by PySC2 and by its consumers.

    Args:
        pysc2_repo_name: The name of the PySC2 repo, as instantiated in
          the local WORKSPACE. When executing this function from the pysc2
          WORKSPACE, this name is "pysc2". But external consumers shouldn't
          use that name as it leads to Python import problems due to the
          pysc2/pysc2 subdirectory. Hence a name such as "pysc2_archive"
          is recommended.

    Example:
        http_archive(
            name = "pysc2_archive",
            # ...
        )

        load("@pysc2_archive//bazel:create_external_repos.bzl",
